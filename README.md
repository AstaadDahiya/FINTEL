## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run the project locally? Follow these simple steps.

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm installed on your machine.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fintel.git
cd fintel
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
This is a crucial step to connect to Firebase and get the live US stock data.

1.  Open the `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  **Firebase Keys**: Find your Firebase project configuration keys. Go to your Firebase Console, click the gear icon for **Project settings**, and under the **General** tab, scroll down to **Your apps**. Select your web app, and under **Firebase SDK snippet**, choose **Config**. Copy the values into your `.env` file.
3.  **Alpha Vantage Keys**: Get a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Add the key to your `.env` file. You can add multiple keys (separated by a comma) to increase your API request limit.

    Your `.env` file should look like this, with your actual keys filled in:
    ```env
    # .env

    # Alpha Vantage API Keys
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEYS=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY_HERE

    # Firebase Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123...:web:...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-...
    ```
    > **Note:** The `.gitignore` file is already configured to prevent your `.env` file from being committed to Git.

### 5. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è How to Deploy to Vercel

Deploying your app to Vercel is the perfect way to share it with the world.

### Step 1: Push Your Project to a Git Repository

Before deploying, your project needs to be hosted on a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

1.  Create a new repository on your preferred Git provider.
2.  Initialize a Git repository in your local project folder: `git init`
3.  Add and commit your files: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
4.  Push your code to the remote repository: `git remote add origin <your-repo-url>` and `git push -u origin main`

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel

1.  **Sign Up & Log In**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and create an account. Using your GitHub account is the easiest way.
2.  **Import Project**:
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click "**Add New...**" > "**Project**".
    *   Connect to your Git account and select the repository for this project.
3.  **Configure Project**: Vercel will automatically detect that you're using Next.js and configure the build settings for you.

### Step 3: Add API Keys (Environment Variables)

This is the most important step for keeping your keys secure. **Never** write your API keys directly in your code.

1.  In the Vercel project configuration screen, expand the "**Environment Variables**" section.
2.  Copy all the key-value pairs from your local `.env` file and add them one by one to Vercel's environment variables. This includes all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` keys and your `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEYS`.
3.  Click "**Add**" for each variable.
4.  Click the "**Deploy**" button.

Vercel will build and deploy your application. Your app will now have access to the API keys you provided, but they won't be visible in your public source code.
